# Simple-AVSAD

### Instructions: How to run the code? -- please finish

The code is based on simple-avsd model.

### Required Environment

1, python 3  
2, pytorch 1.1  
3, numpy  
4, six  
5, coco-evaluation tools for python 3  

### How to run the code?

1, Download all codes and dataset from https://github.com/idansc/simple-avsd  
2, Replace all python files in "code" and "utils" folders with files provided in this repository  
3, Please use command   
> bash run.sh  

to run the code.  
  
The run.sh script has 4 stages  

stage 1 - preparation of dependent packages  
stage 2 - training  
stage 3 - generation of sentences on test-set  
stage 4 - evaluation of generated sentences  

### TODOs

1. Feature analysis: how different features contribute to the task? 

2. Feature fusion: how to integrate features from different modalities?

### How to find papers?

1. got to http://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu.py, we can find recent papers in ECCV, CVPR, ICCV. Then, search key words, for example visual dialog, you can find corresponding works

2. similarly, you can also use google scholar
